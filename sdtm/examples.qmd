title: "SDTM Examples"

For SDTM mapping, there is currently an industry collaboration supported by
CDISC for the `{roak}` R package. Read more [here](https://www.cdisc.org/oak).

Once this completes and the package is made available as open source, we will
be able to add examples showcasing how best to use this alongside other
pharmaverse packages in this space - such as `{datacutr}` and `{sdtmchecks}`.
